ven the following matrix A:

            [1   1   0 ]
      A =   [0   1   0 ]
            [0   0   1 ]

Calculate the real numbers x and y such that:

2A + xA + yI = 0 ( I is the 3 x 3 identity matrix)

In the text box below, enter the integers x and y each on a new line, respectively.
Do not leave any leading or trailing spaces.

Solution:
