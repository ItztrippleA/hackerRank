Matrix Addition

Add the two 3x3 matrices given below and find the integers corresponding to a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h, and i :

[1  2  3]       [4  5  6]     [a b c]
[2  3  4]   +   [7  8  9]  =  [d e f]
[1  1  1]       [4  5  7]     [g h i]
To submit your answer, enter the resultant values of each of the nine integers (i.e. a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h, and i) on a
new line and click Submit Code.

Input Format
There is no input for this challenge; calculate the values of a through i using the matrices given above.

Output Format

In the text box below, enter the values of each of the nine integers on a new line.
You must have a total of nine lines of output and the integers must be printed in order
(i.e. a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h, and i, respectively).
