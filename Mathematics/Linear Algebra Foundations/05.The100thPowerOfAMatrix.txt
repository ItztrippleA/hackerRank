Given the following matrix A :

            [1   1   0 ]
      A =   [0   1   0 ]
            [0   0   1 ]

We compute that

A^100 =

    [A B 0]
    [0 C 0]
    [0 D E]
In the text box below, enter the values of the integers A-E each in a new line.
Do not leave any extra leading or trailing spaces.


Solution:
