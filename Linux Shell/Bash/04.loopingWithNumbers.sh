# for loops in Bash can be used in several ways:
# - iterating between two integers, a and b
# - iterating between two integers, a and b, and incrementing by c each time
# - iterating through the elements of an array, etc.
#
# Use for loops to display the natural numbers from 1 to 50.

for i in {1..50}; do echo "$i"; done
